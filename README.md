# Manual Music Score Classifier

This repository contains a small WPF application that is used for manually classifying small images into the categories "Scores" or "Other" and automatically shows you the next image after a user classification.


See https://github.com/apacha/MusicScoreClassifier for the automatic classifier that uses Deep Learning to achieve the same.

See https://github.com/apacha/MobileMusicScoreClassifier for the mobile Android application that uses a trained model to perform real-time classification on a mobile device.

# Building the application
This application is a C#/Wpf application that requires Visual Studio to build.
